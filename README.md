TITLE
      'ELASTICREGRESS': lasso, ridge regression and elastic net regression.

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR(S)
      
      The elasticregress package is a Stata implementation of the Friedman,
      Hastie and Tibshirani (2010, JStatSoft) coordinate descent algorithm
      for elastic net regression and its famous special cases: lasso and
      ridge regression. These regression estimates tend to have better out-
      of-sample fit than those from ordinary least squares. When tuning 
      parameters are not provided by the user, elasticregress can find them
      with K-fold cross-validation.
